# musicmanage
Renames files based on ID3 tags, in the form /artist/album/songname

Usage: Run in the directory you want to rename the files of.

Note: This program deletes image files, text files, cue files and nfo files. Make sure you run it in a folder which just has music in!

It is designed to rename music which has been freshly downloaded, which often is named for example, file01.mp3, file02.mp3, etc, but has valid tags, to their correct names and folders. It then deletes album art, cue files, and text descriptions, along with any empty folders.

It would be trivial to extend this program to rename in user defined configurations, but I only ever rename in the form /artist/album/songname
